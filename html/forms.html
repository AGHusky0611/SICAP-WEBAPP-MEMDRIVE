                    Hi! I Am Christian, a 3rd Year BS Computer Science student who loves Photography.<br>
                    Currently the Head of Photoguild in RPG, I was an Associate Director for ComPub in Supreme Student Council (2014-2025)<br>
                    and currently the Secretary for Operations in SICAP.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Photography is capturing the moments that will last forever. An art that makes time stop and lets you see<br>
                    the whole picture. Through my lens, I strive to capture the essence of moments, emotions, and stories that<br>
                    would otherwise fade with time. Each photograph is a frozen moment in the continuous flow of life.

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="content-container">
            <div class="info">
                <p> 
                    I'm a passionate photographer and computer science student with a unique perspective that combines<br>
                    technical knowledge with artistic vision. My journey in photography began 5 years ago when I first<br>
                    picked up a camera, and since then I've developed a style that focuses on portrait and street photography.
                    <br><br>
                    My technical background in computer science gives me an edge in post-processing and digital workflow,<br>
                    allowing me to enhance images while maintaining their authentic feel. I believe that the best photographs<br>
                    are those that tell stories and evoke emotions.
                    <br><br>
                    When I'm not coding or taking pictures, you can find me exploring new places, attending photography<br>
                    workshops, or mentoring aspiring photographers in our community.
